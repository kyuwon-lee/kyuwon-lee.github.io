I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University's Center for the Study of Democratic Politics (CSDP). In July 2024, I will be joining the University of Southern California (USC)'s POIR Department as an Assistant Professor. I received my Ph.D. from the Wilf Family Department of Politics at New York University.  

My research interests are bureaucratic and interest group politics in the United States. My current research focuses on strategic interactions between bureaucracies and organized interests in settings such as government contracts, environmental regulatory enforcement and public advisory meetings. My work leverages a range of research designs and data sources, including game theory, causal inference methods for observational data, text analysis, and administrative data. My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Journal of Politics_.
