      The president's dominant influence on administrative policymaking has sparked public concerns about resulting inefficiencies at federal agencies. I examine how the possibility of future electoral turnover can limit agencies' engagement in presidential favoritism, focusing on policy areas where Congress can use informal means to constrain agencies' actions under the separation of powers system. In those areas, forward-looking agencies might alter their behavior to accommodate future constraints from the opposition Congress, even given substantial presidential influence. I evaluate these incentives using federal contract data in the United States. I find that as the probability of congressional turnover increases, federal agencies under unified government are more likely to award lower-cost contracts through competitive bidding in the expectation that the future Congress might compel agencies to abandon non-competitive contracts given to firms politically connected to the president. My findings challenge the dominant perspective that electoral turnover necessarily degrades bureaucratic performance.

      <summary><b>abstract</b></summary>
      There is growing concern about the movement of individuals from private sectors to bureaucracies, yet it is unclear how bureaucratic revolving doors affect connected firms’ political participation. We argue that when connected individuals enter government, connected firms reduce their proactive forms of participation because their connected bureaucrats possess firm-specific technical and legal knowledge to help them achieve their policy objectives. We test our intuition by constructing a novel data set on career trajectories of bureaucrats in the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) and firms that are connected to USTR’s revolving-door bureaucrats. Empirical results show that firms with connections to USTR bureaucrats decrease their lobbying spending and participation on advisory committees under the USTR. The decrease in political participation is stronger when connected bureaucrats are more influential in policy production. Our findings suggest that decreases in interest groups’ political activities might not imply that their influence on policy making is diminished.

      This paper explores the transformative role of GPT in political science research, demonstrating its potential to streamline data collection and analysis processes. By automating the extraction of information from diverse data sources—such as historical documents, meeting minutes, news articles, and unstructured digital content—GPT significantly reduces the time and financial resources traditionally required for data management. We explore how GPT’s capabilities complement the work of human research assistants, combining automated efficiency with human oversight to enhance both the reliability and depth of research outputs. The integration of GPT not only makes comprehensive data collection and analysis accessible to researchers with limited resources, it also enhances the overall efficiency and scope of research in political science. This article underscores the increasing importance of artificial intelligence tools in advancing empirical research within the field.

"Firms' Political Response to Regulatory Capacity: Evidence from State-Level Workforce Shocks" (with <a href='https://dahyunc.github.io'>Dahyun Choi</a>).  **<font size="2"> [pdf]</font>**

      <summary><b>abstract</b></summary>
      How do firms adjust their political activities in response to regulatory agencies’ capacity, and are their behaviors constrained by their surrounding political environments? Empirical scrutiny of these questions has been limited due to endogeneity and lack of comparable cases. We propose using state-level regulatory politics to better address these questions. Using original datasets on the workforce of U.S. state environmental agencies from 2000-2019, we estimate the causal effect of unanticipated workforce shocks that arise from the gap between the actual and appropriated workforce size. We find that regulated firms increase campaign contributions to state legislators and governors while decreasing contributions to House representatives in response to workforce shocks. Specifically, firms contributes more to moderate state legislators but less to conservative House representatives who are conventionally considered to be their political allies. We also find that state-level restrictions on corporate donations do not significantly curb firms' political responsiveness to workforce shocks. These findings contribute to our understanding of interest group strategies in regulatory environments.

"Bureaucratic Constraints on Embedded Liberalism: Evidence from the Trade Adjustments Assistance." (with <a href='https://cfbalcazar.github.io'>Felipe Balcazar</a>).  **<font size="2"> [pdf]</font>**

      <summary><b>abstract</b></summary>
      Scholars have long claimed that international integration can be sustained by providing sufficient economic compensation to workers adversely affected by it. We argue that the success of this social contract—Embedded Liberalism—also depends on the bureaucracies in charge of delivering the compensation. Bureaucratic delays in delivering compensation might erode citizens' beliefs in the government's capacity to uphold the social contract, leading them to reduce their support for globalization. We test our theory on the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program in the United States. By exploiting the quasi-random assignment of TAA petitions to individual bureaucrats, we estimate the causal effect of being assigned to bureaucrats with idiosyncratic propensities for prompt petition processing on the attitudes of over 200,000 voters from 2006 to 2016. Empirical results support our theory and additionally indicate that labor unions play a crucial role in informing voters about TAA bureaucrats' performance. We demonstrate that bureaucracies could be key to understanding the backlash against globalization.
